# Binary Search Tree Showcase

This repository contains a Swift project that demonstrates the implementation and functionality of a Binary Search Tree (BST) data structure. BST is a popular data structure that maintains a sorted order of elements, allowing for efficient search, insert, and delete operations. In this project, you will find a comprehensive example showcasing how a BST works and how it can be utilized in real-world applications.
